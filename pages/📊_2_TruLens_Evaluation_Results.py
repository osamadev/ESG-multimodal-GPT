    # 🌟 Gemini LLM Evaluation Results with RAG Metrics

    This document presents the evaluation results of the Gemini Language Model (LLM) using the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) triad of metrics. These metrics are crucial for assessing the relevancy of the model's answers to user prompts.

    ## 📊 Overview

    The RAG approach combines the power of retrieval and language generation to provide more accurate and relevant responses. This evaluation focuses on three key metrics:

    1. **Relevance of Retrieved Documents**: Measures how relevant the retrieved documents are to the user prompt.
    2. **Quality of Answer Generation**: Assesses the quality of answers generated based on the retrieved documents.
    3. **Overall Response Coherence**: Evaluates the overall coherence and context-awareness of the final response.

    ## 🔍 Evaluation Metrics

    ### 1️⃣ Relevance of Retrieved Documents
    - **Description**: Analyzes the relevance of documents retrieved by the model in response to a query.
    - **Importance**: Ensures that the foundational information used for generating responses is accurate and pertinent.

    ### 2️⃣ Quality of Answer Generation
    - **Description**: Assesses the accuracy and appropriateness of the answers generated based on the retrieved information.
    - **Importance**: Critical for ensuring the utility and reliability of the responses.

    ### 3️⃣ Overall Response Coherence
    - **Description**: Evaluates how well the generated response integrates the retrieved information coherently.
    - **Importance**: Ensures that the response is not only accurate but also contextually appropriate and coherent.
